                <p>In temperate regions, cold winters pose a risk to the leaves of broadleaf trees and other perennials, and
                    so these plants drop their leaves in a controlled fashion to reduce injuries and conserve energy. This
                    event is usually triggered by the declining day length and falling temperatures of autumn. Leaf
                    abscission (the technical term for the dropping of leaves) begins with the degradation of chlorophyll.
                    As the green fades, yellow and orange pigments known as carotenoids are revealed in the leaves of many
                    species.</p>
